# SelfFound Addon for WoW
Limit senseless Auction House and Trading until max level.
How the game should have been from the beginning.
Not too hard, not too easy, just makes sense.
Should work with TurtleWoW, Vanilla, The Burning Crusade (TBC), Wrath of the Lich King (Wotlk).

### Important Specifics
* No mail restriction, in order to send valuable items to bank characters.
* Until max lvl, Trading can only be used in instances in order to share drinks, heartstones, etc.
* Until max lvl, Auction House can only be used to buy items, since some quests require it.
