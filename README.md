# SensibleTrading - Addon for WoW
Limit senseless use of Auction House and Trading until max level. \
This is how the game should have been from the beginning. \
Should work with TurtleWoW, Vanilla, The Burning Crusade (TBC), Wrath of the Lich King (Wotlk).

### Important Specifics
* No mail restriction, in order to send valuable items to bank characters.
* Until max lvl, Trading can only be used in instances in order to share drinks, heartstones, etc.
* Until max lvl, Auction House can only be used to buy items, since some quests require it.
