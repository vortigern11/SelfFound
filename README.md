# SelfFound Addon for WoW
Basically a SSF without the Solo part. \
This addon will prevent you from Trading, using the Auction House and Mailing unless you meet certain conditions. \
Works with TurtleWoW, Vanilla, The Burning Crusade (TBC), Wrath of the Lich King (Wotlk).

### Important Specifics
Addon mode can only be changed at lvl 1 ! \
Trading can be used in instances in order to share drinks, heartstones, etc. \
If a bank character levels up, the addon will be disabled for him. \
These are the available modes and from what level Mail, AH and Trading can be used:

| Mode     | Mail Lvl     | Auction House | Trading      |
| -        | -            | -             | -            |
