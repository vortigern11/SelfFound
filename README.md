# SelfFound Addon for WoW
Basically a SSF without the Solo part. \
This addon will prevent you from Trading, using the Auction House and Mailing unless you meet certain conditions. \
Works with TurtleWoW, Vanilla, The Burning Crusade (TBC), Wrath of the Lich King (Wotlk).

### Important Specifics
* ! Addon mode can only be changed at lvl 1 !
* ! If a bank character levels up, the addon will be disabled for him. !
* Trading can be used in instances in order to share drinks, heartstones, etc.
* Sane mode is recommended for people who haven't leveled to max before.
* Max mode is for veterans or people who like a greater challenge.
* Hardcore mode is for maniacs with a DIY mentality.
* Bank mode is for alts to store your main's items.

These are the available modes and lvl requirements for using Mail, AH and Trading:
